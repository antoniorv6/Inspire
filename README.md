Inspire is a Linux PC video game made from scratch with C++ and OpenGL by Zenon Games, a students group at University of Alicante. 

One of the core aspects of the game is the optimization goal. The game was required to work in low-end PC (it has proven good performance in a Intel Celeron 3000 series processor with 2 GB for RAM, where 700MB are reserved for video memory, no graphics dedicated card).
